It's a TCP based simple Server to Client File Transfer application. I didn't use any thread, so it is one diectional (Server to Client).
During testing period, I can transfer different types of file upto 5.25 MB, such as .pdf, .docx, .pptx, .jpg, .png, .txt etc.

First run server.java and give your source directory.
Then run client.java and give the path of download directory.
